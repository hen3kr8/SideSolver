INteresting progress notes:

25 may:

After locating the digits ( i.e cutting up the grid into 9 x 9 ) I cropped them to try remove the existing grid border.

however,  The images of the digits contained noise (the area around the digit in the cell are not 100% white), as expected.

The mnist dataset does not contain any background noise, hence all these noise naturally noisy images are classified as 8.


Possible solution:
Apply floodfilling to the cell after cropping it, hereby selecting only the digit.
